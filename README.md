# ISR Dataset C-VEP EEG

C-VEP EEG Dataset created for the paper: [A User-Identification system based on Code-modulated Visual Evoked Potentials with LED stimulation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9465083).

## Source code

Functions necessary to load .mat files and to segment session data in C-VEP time segments are **.m** files in folder [**scripts**](scripts). 
The data from the differents datasets are stored in **.mat** files containing pre-processed C-VEP EEG data arrays:
- Data from the ISR Dataset C-VEP EEG is stored in folder [**ISR-Sequence**](https://github.com/franroque12/ISR-Dataset-C-VEP-EEG/tree/main/ISR_Sequence) and in folder [**Aminaka-Sequence**](https://github.com/franroque12/ISR-Dataset-C-VEP-EEG/tree/main/Aminaka_Sequence)
- Data for the Benchmark C-VEP Dataset, adapted from paper reference [**\[19\]**](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-15373-x), is stored in folder [**Wittevrongel Sequence**](https://github.com/franroque12/ISR-Dataset-C-VEP-EEG/tree/main/Wittevrongel_Sequences).

## Requirements

For the scripts we recommend
- Matlab r2020.a

## Data structure

In each dataset folder there are several .mat files named Tx.mat. Each file contains a 4-D array in the format (channels, time samples, user ID, block).
